Instead, could we add barbecue sauce to it? That's really what I'm craving right now. Also, yes, I would like it as a meal, thanks for asking. 

Now, when you mention the meal, I'm assuming it comes with a side and a drink, is that correct? If so, I'd love to have the chili cheese fries as my side. They sound absolutely delicious and I can't resist a good cheesy fry. And for the drink, could we do a mango shake? I'm a big fan of mango and shakes so this seems like the perfect combo for me.

Also, besides the Bratwurst Dog meal, I'd like to order some Onion Chips. Medium size should be good. And if it's not too much, could I also get a medium Sprite? Just to have a little variety in my drinks. 

I hope that clears things up. Thanks for your patience!
