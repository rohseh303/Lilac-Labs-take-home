2024-12-25 02:25:56,058 - INFO - GPT-4 response: NO, THAT'S IT! I've been very specific with my order, and I expect it to be made exactly as I've described! I am not in the mood for any mistakes today. I have been very clear with the customization of my Plain Classic Hot Dog, and I want it to be made PERFECTLY! The sauerkraut must be extra, the cheddar cheese should be just added and not too much, and I want the bacon also extra. The pickles and mustard should also just be added, and make sure there's NO celery salt at all! I want extra brown mustard, mushrooms, and chili. Go easy on the American cheese and absolutely NO chipotle aioli or citrus pineapple aioli! Add grilled onions to it as well. The side of sweet potato fries better be cooked to perfection and the Rockstar drink better be chilled! This is all I want, nothing more, nothing less! Make sure my order is right or else there will be a problem!
